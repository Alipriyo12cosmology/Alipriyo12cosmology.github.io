## Bio 

Hi, I am Dhrubajyoti, and I am currently a PhD scholar at the [Department of Physics](https://physics.iitm.ac.in), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Chennai. I work with [Dr. Vaibhav Madhok](https://sites.google.com/view/madhok) and [Dr. Sayan Gupta](https://home.iitm.ac.in/sayan/).

My interests are in the area of complex networks and dynamical systems. I currently stay on campus at IIT Madras in Bhadra Hostel, while my native place is back in the wee town of [Kalyani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalyani,_West_Bengal), West Bengal. Apart from my research interests, I am passionate about photography and programming in general. I also play cricket from time to time.
